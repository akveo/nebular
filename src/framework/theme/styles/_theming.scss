      We have to use :host instead of :host-context($theme), to be able to prefix theme class
      with something defined inside of @content, by prefixing &.
      For example this scss code:
        .nb-theme-default {
          .some-selector & {
            ...
          }
        }
      Will result in next css:
        .some-selector .nb-theme-default {
          ...
        }

      It doesn't work with :host-context because angular splitting it in two selectors and removes
      prefix in one of the selectors.
