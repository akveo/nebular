# 3.5.0-4.0.0

## Migration Purposes
Nebular 4.0 is a significant improvement and rework of the previous versions. We believe these changes bring Nebular to the new level of quality awesomeness with:

- Updated look&feel with Eva Design System;
- New convenient and flexible Theming system;
- Custom CSS properties support in theming;
- Unified component interfaces (`@Input`'s and `@Output`'s);
- New Dark theme;
- Support of SVG Eva Icons.

To achieve all of this and allow Nebular to grow faster and better, we had to refactor a lot of internal implementations, as well as *public APIs*.

We hope that next Nebular versions won't receive such significant upgrades and amount of breaking changes will be kept as low as possible.

## Migration Steps

The following migration steps are required to update:

- Update Angular to version 8 **required**
- Update Nebular to version 4 **required**
- Fix imports and component properties **required**
- Migrate Theme **depends**
- Migrate to `eva-icons`  **optional**
- Other possible changes **optional**

### Update Angular to version 8
Nebular 4.0 is based on Angular version 8, thus the very first step is to update the last.

Since Angular has an automatic migration `ng update`  in place, the update will look as follows:
`ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`

Most of the changes will be done automatically.
If you have any issues or your setup is more complex - refer to the https://update.angular.io/, select your Angular version and follow the steps

### Update Nebular to version 4

`ng update @nebular/theme`

Additionally if you use any other Nebular packages, you can add them like this:

`ng update @nebular/theme @nebular/auth @nebular/security`

Since Nebular requires `@angular/cdk`, install the lastest version:

`ng update @angular/cdk`

### Fix imports and component properties

Nebular 4.0 unifies a lot of component properties making them more intuitive and easier to use:
