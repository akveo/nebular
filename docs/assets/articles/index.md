It's primary goal is to assemble together and connect the most awesome features and libraries creating an efficient ecosystem to speed up and simplify the development.

## Current state
Nebular is in *beta* now, meaning that we are on the final path to the release.

## What's included

- Reusable UI Kit 
- Flexibly configurable themes with **hot-reload**
- Configurable layouts 
- Auth module with multiple providers
- Modular (dependencies available as npm modules)
- Ready-to-go project structure ([Admin Starter Kit](#/docs/installation/based-on-starter-kit))

## Assumptions

This documentation assumes that you are already familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript, Angular, CSS and Bootstrap.
