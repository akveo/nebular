# Auth Module

The main goal of the Auth module is to provide a pluggable set of components and services for an easier setup of the authentication layer for Angular applications.
The module separates the UI part (login/register/etc components) from the business logic with the help of the authentication `Strategies` layer. 

<div class="note note-info">
  <div class="note-title">Note</div>
  <div class="note-body">
    The setup still requires communication with backend services.

## Auth Strategies
  - `NbDummyAuthStrategy` - simple strategy for testing purposes, could be used for simulating backend responses while API is in the development;
  - `NbPasswordAuthStrategy` - the most common email/login/password authentication strategy.
  - `NbOAuth2AuthStrategy` - the most popular authentication framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on HTTP service.

## Other helper services
  - `NbAuthService` - facade service to communicate with a configured strategy;
  - `NbTokenService` - service that allows you to manage authentication token - get, set, clear and also listen to token changes over time;
  - `NbTokenLocalStorage` - storage service for storing tokens in a browser local storage;
  - `NbAuthJWTToken` and `NbAuthSimpleToken` - helper classes to work with your token;
