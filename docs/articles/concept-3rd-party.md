# 3rd Party Components

Currently Nebular Theme system is integrated with the following 3rd party modules:

- ng2-smart-table;

It means that we've created style overriding for these modules, so that you can change component's look & feel using Nebular theme variables.
For example, if you change the `color-primary` variable, components using this color will be changed accordingly.
