# Eva Design System Theme

In Eva Design System a **theme** is a set of semantic variables and connections between them, that represents the application's look & feel to achieves the following goals:

- create new visual themes easily;
- flexibly change look & feel of the application by managing variables, without changing components' styles;
- switch between visual themes in app runtime without page reload;
- support of CSS properties.

## A Theme

In Nebular terms - **theme** is a sass map, structured in a particular way. Here's a gist of how it looks like:

```scss
$theme: (
  // ...
  color-danger-100: #fff2f2,
  color-danger-200: #ffd6d9,
  color-danger-300: #ffa8b4,
  color-danger-400: #ff708d,
  // ...
  color-danger-900: #700940,

  /* Basic colors - for backgrounds and borders and texts */

  color-basic-100: white,
  color-basic-200: #f7f8fa,
  color-basic-300: #edf0f4,
  color-basic-400: #dde1eb,
  // ...
  color-basic-1100: #131729,

  /* Status colors states - focus, hover, default, active, disabled  */

  color-primary-focus: color-primary-700,
  color-primary-hover: color-primary-400,
  color-primary-default: color-primary-500,
  color-primary-active: color-primary-600,
  color-primary-disabled: color-primary-300,
  // ...
);
```

Each theme is divided into the following semantic groups:

- Colors
- Backgrounds & Borders
- Text Colors
- Fonts & Text Styles
- General Theme Variables
<hr>

## Colors

All available color within the theme. 5 semantic colors (`primary`, `success`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`) and `basic` color (backgrounds and texts).
Each color has a pallet of 9 shades, except for `basic`, which has 11 shades. These colors mostly used by `status` variants of the components.

Primary color shades:
```scss
color-primary-100: #f2f6ff,
color-primary-200: #d9e4ff,
color-primary-300: #a6c1ff,
color-primary-400: #598bff,
color-primary-500: #3366ff,
color-primary-600: #284de0,
color-primary-700: #2541cc,
color-primary-800: #192f9e,
color-primary-900: #14236e,
```

You can also tune colors used for element states:

```scss

color-primary-focus: color-primary-700,
color-primary-hover: color-primary-400,
color-primary-default: color-primary-500,
color-primary-active: color-primary-600,
color-primary-disabled: color-primary-300,
```

You can adjust these settings for each of the colors, to make states use lighter or darker colors.

## Backgrounds & Borders

A theme has 3 backgrounds (`basic`, `alternative`, `primary`) each of 4 shades and also 3 borders, each of 5 shades (background shades count + 1).
`basic` and `alternative` backgrounds and borders utilize `basic` color shades as a source. `primary` backgrounds and borders use `primary` color.
Basic backgrounds and borders heavily used by components (cards, accordions, menu, etc), when alternative (tooltips) and primary only for particular use cases,
to distinguish some of the components.

Basic backgrounds and borders:
```scss
background-basic-color-1: color-basic-100,
background-basic-color-2: color-basic-200,
background-basic-color-3: color-basic-300,
background-basic-color-4: color-basic-400,

border-basic-color-1: color-basic-100,
border-basic-color-2: color-basic-200,
border-basic-color-3: color-basic-300,
border-basic-color-4: color-basic-400,
border-basic-color-5: color-basic-500,
```

the most used of these are:
 
- `background-basic-color-1` - the lightest one, usually used for top sitting elements - cards, headers, etc. 
- `background-basic-color-2` - for background of the layout and input controls (inputs, checkboxes, etc)

And vice-versa for dark themes:

```scss
background-basic-color-1: color-basic-800, // <- notice how we start
background-basic-color-2: color-basic-900, // with the end part
background-basic-color-3: color-basic-1000,// of the basic shades
background-basic-color-4: color-basic-1100,

border-basic-color-1: color-basic-800,
border-basic-color-2: color-basic-900,
border-basic-color-3: color-basic-1000,
border-basic-color-4: color-basic-1100,
border-basic-color-5: color-basic-1100,
```
<hr>  

## Text Colors

There are 5 colors within the theme: `basic` - main text color, used on top of `basic` backgrounds `alternate` - alternative color used on top of `alternate` backgrounds,
`control` - used on top of `status` colors (`primary`, `success`, etc), `disabled` color - to indicate text/component disabled state
and `hint` - for secondary texts (for example placeholders and captions).
 
Text colors use `basic` shades as a source:
```scss
text-basic-color: color-basic-1000,
text-alternate-color: color-basic-100,
text-control-color: color-basic-100,
text-disabled-color: color-basic-500,
text-hint-color: color-basic-700,
```
<hr>

## Fonts & Text Styles

Each theme has two available fonts: `default` and `secondary`. `secondary` font used for headers, while the default for the rest of the elements.

There are 14 text styles:
- 6 `heading` styles, used by h1-h6 elements 
- 2 `subtitle` styles, used as a text of most of controls (inputs, menus, etc)
- 2 `paragraph` styles, regular text
- 2 `caption` styles, used by smaller texts, like tooltip or input caption
- `label` style, used by label element
- `button` text style, used by button element

Each styles describes text `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-width` and `line-height`, for instance, caption text style:
```scss
text-caption-font-family: font-family-primary,
text-caption-font-size: 0.75rem,
text-caption-font-weight: 400,
text-caption-line-height: 1rem,
```
<hr>

Adjust these styles to change text style of specific groups of elements.
