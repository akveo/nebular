Starting Nebular from <a href="https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin/" target="_blank">ngx-admin</a> starter kit is the easiest way to run your first Nebular application. 
 
Please note, that **ngx-admin** is just a frontend application. Backend integration can be done relatively simple, but you should be aware that all the data is mocked using JavaScript objects. 
If you want the data to be dynamic, you should consider developing a backend integration by your own. 
The Nebular team doesn't consider providing generic integration layer as a part of this project because every backend API has a different structure in terms of data format and URLs.

    Please note that **it is not possible** to build ngx-admin **without these tools** and it will not be possible because of the way how Angular is built.

## Running local copy

To run a local copy in development mode, execute:

```bash
npm start
```

Go to <a href="http://0.0.0.0:4200" target="_blank">http://0.0.0.0:4200</a> or <a href="http://localhost:4200" target="_blank">http://localhost:4200</a> in your browser.
<hr class="section-end">

To run the local copy in a production mode and build the sources, execute:

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

To create a bundle in production mode, execute:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

This will clear up your `dist` folder (where release files are located) and generate a release build.
Now you can copy the sources from the `dist` folder and use it with any backend framework or simply [put it under a web server](#/docs/guides/server-deployment).

## Next

- [Deploying to production server](#/docs/guides/server-deployment).
- [Updating ngx-admin to the latest verion](#/docs/guides/ngx-admin-update).
