Nebular is a set of modules for <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>. Despite it is not required to know Angular framework to set up your first Nebular project, it is highly recommended to go through the Angular tutorial beforehand and be familiar with basic Angular concepts.

## Quickstart tutorials

Based on a current setup of your project and your goals, there are two starting points:

- **[Starting based on our Nebular Admin starter kit](#/docs/installation/based-on-starter-kit-ngxadmin)** Consider this tutorial if you are building admin or any other back-office application and you need a template or a good starting kit.
- **[Adding into existing Angular Project](#/docs/installation/add-into-existing-project)** This tutorial explains how to use Nebular if you already have some Angular code.

Please consider creating an issue on GitHub if your use case is not described above. But we kindly ask to always look through the documentation and the list of existing issues first.

## I'm new to Angular or web development in general

Quite often we receive emails and messages from people who ask us for the advice we can give them if they are completely new to software engineering and/or Angular in particular. Well, we can't say that there's some general way, unfortunately. Each advice should be aimed at a particular person, his current skills set and goals. That's why we believe that each person knows better for himself. But in any case, there are multiple resources like https://www.coursera.org/ or https://egghead.io/ which focus on providing online education.
